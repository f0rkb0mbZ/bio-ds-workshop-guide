## Applied data science in biology

#### Analysis of organized data by principal component analysis

1) We start with mass spectrometric data of metabolites from a group of people, some of which are diabetic. The data will be in `.xlsx` format(Excel Sheet). 
2) The `aim` is to find the simplest machine learning algorithm to predict whether somebody is diabetic or not.

#### Analysis of noisy data: genome

We begin with the entire genome of a few bacteria and try to:

1) Query the genome at the Linux command line.
2) Find the origin (Ori site) of replication with python.
3) Find the regulatory gene of an Operon with python.
4) Assemble the genome of a bacterium from fragmented Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) reads.
5) The `aim` is to demonstrate the approximations that can be achieved in mining very large amounts of data, even without experimental verification.

#### Analysis of noisy data: images

1) The `aim` is to understand the working principle of convolutional neural networks (and how you can make one). 
2) Some examples of predicting pathological images.
